I have started working on the PHP system again. Right now I am converting all pages from ASP to PHP. In the mean time I also translate any Dutch to English. The database gets an overhaul and I am also starting to get more involved in the GIT source control. I have started using NetBeans which I like.

The ASP system I am translating is the one from 2012. Once the PHP system is working properly I will continue porting changes from my 2014 version (which I have only working locally).

There will be a demo online, hosted on my own site, where I can deploy and test the system. See [demo site](http://quizbaker.vanderblonk.com)
